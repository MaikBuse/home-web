            The contents of this online offering have been created with care and based on
            my current level of knowledge, but are for informational purposes only and do
            not have any legally binding effect, unless it concerns legally mandatory information
            (e.g., the imprint, privacy policy, terms and conditions, or mandatory consumer instructions).
            I reserve the right to modify or delete the contents in whole or in part, provided that

          <p className="mt-2 border-b border-zinc-700/40 text-white">
            As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages
            in accordance with general laws, as per Section 7, Paragraph 1 of the German
            Telemedia Act (TMG). However, according to Sections 8 to 10 of the TMG, as a
            service provider, I am not obligated to monitor transmitted or stored external
            information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations
            to remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected.
            However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a
            specific infringement. Upon notification of such violations, I will remove this content
            immediately.

            My offer includes links to external third-party websites, over whose content I
            have no control. Therefore, I cannot assume any liability for these external contents.
            The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content
            of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the
            time of linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a
            permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence
            of an infringement. Upon notification of violations, I will remove such links immediately.
